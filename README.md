# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview
Why we need this project?

*Part 1 History*

We know that this problem is spreading fast and needs to be Limited as New York time has stated "AS fake news bread slice more readers shrug at the truth".
Many research paper has been published in this area,As the readers come across many fake news when they read a real news they believe that it is also a fake news.
well detecting a fake news is not an easy task as that can be many definitions of a fake news, but is some extent it is possible using some machine learning models we will also be needing to use NLP techniques to make computer understand the news as there is a waste material of text involved.

## Dependencies
⋅⋅* Pandas.
⋅⋅* Numpy.
⋅⋅* NLTK.
⋅⋅* Matplotlib.
⋅⋅* sklearn.
⋅⋅* sqlite3.

## How we tackle this problem?
We use Natural Language Processing to rectify the problem, We got a data set of 7000 news articles which well labelled as fake or real so we use 33% of the data to train the model and rest of 67% data to test the model,With this our project concluded with 93% of the accuracy,

## Future
We are hoping to Create a website, which will have our machine learning model as a backend and user will be able to paste any news article which he/she thinks is not legitimate.
Our website will take that article and will classify it is fake or real so that the user can be able to make this decision.
